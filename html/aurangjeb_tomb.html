				<h2>history :</h2>  <br>
				<p>
					In the late 1600s, after the Mughal Empire expanded its reign to South
                     India till Golconda, a downfall had begun due to continuous wars and 
                     battles that lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives
                      and an insane amount of money. The expenses, that also included wasteful
                       indulgences, drove the Mughal Empire to bankruptcy. At the end of his 
                       life, the emperor went through a period of introspection and guilt, and
                        as per his instructions, a simple funeral and his burial were carried 
                        out at Khuldabad where he has purchased the burial ground. It is said 
                        that the entire expense did not cross INR 15/- at that time. </p>  <br>

                    After the funeral, Aurangzeb was given the title of Khuld-Makan which means
                     the one whose abode is an eternity. A wooden porch with Persian inscriptions
                      was erected all around the tomb over a platform. But, because of its simplicity,
                       the tomb was sort of left unmarked. Around the mid-1700s, a British Statesman,
                        Lord Curzon, discovered the tomb and built a white marble encasing and flooring
                         around it. The simple yet elegant structure that we get to see today, is an open-air
                          tomb with a domed portico, open ceiling and screens of marble with Jali work. A 
                          large piece of marble with inscriptions that contain Aurangzeb’s complete name with
                           his title can also be seen in one corner around the tomb.

				<h3>Structure of Aurangzeb’s Tomb :</h3>   <br>
                <p>
                    The tomb of Aurangzeb is simpler than one would expect from a Mughal Emperor.
                     Aurangzeb asked for a modest, open-air grave which showed his deep devotion
                      to his Islamic beliefs. The translated Persian epitaph on his tomb reads:
                       "The rich may well construct domes of gold and silver on their graves! 
                       For the poor folks like me, the sky is enough (of a dome to shelter my grave)!"

                The platform over the tomb is made of red sandstone, which is less than 3 yards
                 in length. The tomb has been covered with soil on which herbs grow. After Aurangzeb’s
                  burial, he was given the posthumous title of Khuld-makan, which means he whose abode
                   is in eternity. In 1911, a marble structure was erected around the grave under the 
                   orders of Lord Curzon. The tomb is remarkably plain and the perforated marble screens
                    on three sides are the only elements of decoration.

                 The dargah also houses the tomb of Aurangzeb’s son, Azam Shah and his wife; along-with
                  the tomb of Asaf Jah I, who was the founder of the Hyderabad dynasty.

				<h3>Location of the Tomb of Aurangzeb :</h3>   <br>
				<p>
					The tomb of Aurangzeb is located in the village of Kuldabad in the district
                     of Aurangabad in the state of Maharashtra. It is located in the south-east
                     ern corner of the complex of the dargah of the Sufi saints Sheikh Burhan-u’d-din
                      Gharib and Sheikh Zainuddin, who were his spiritual gurus.
				</p>

				<h3>How to reach Aurangzeb’s Tomb :</h3>   <br>
				<p>

					The nearest airport is at Aurangabad. Jalgaon is the closest railway station
                     which is connected to other parts of Maharashtra. However, Bhusaval, about 30 km
                      from Jalgaon is well connected to all parts of India.
