				<h3>Caves Group - Caves I to X :</h3>   <br>
				<p>
                   <b> Cave I:</b> This is a vihara or a Buddhist temple with an unfinished interior. 
                    The hall of this cave intended to have 28 pillars. However, only four par
                    tially destroyed pillars remain. There is also a verandah supported by eig
                    ht pillars. The wall of the verandah has two windows and three doors surro
                    unded by carvings of Nagaraja at the base of the door frame and Yakshis as
                     consorts of Nagaraja. Three huge sculptures of Buddha are carved in the v
                     eranda. The pillars of Cave I are very interesting as they have salabhanji
                     kas or tree goddesses and figures of ganas carved on them on all the four 
                     sides of the square base. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                   <b> Cave II:</b> This cave has a shrine at the centre of the verandah supported b
                    y four pillars. The Buddha is seated on a lion throne in pralambapadasana
                     and his hands are in the dharmachakra mudra. Figures of two attendants, 
                     Maitreya and Padmapani, are carved outside the shrine on either side. Th
                     e walls around the shrine are completely covered with figures of Buddha 
                     depicting Miracle of Saraswati and there is a circumambulation path aroun
                     d the shrine. </p> <br> 
                   <p>
                   <b> Cave III:</b> A vihara with a verandah supported by four pillars, this cave 
                    has a shrine at the centre of the main hall. The doors are stunning with
                     floral designs and Naga guardians on the arches. The pillars are also c
                     arved with flowers, trees and animals, ornamental and geometrical design
                     s and the enchanting tree goddesses. The idol is seated on a double lotu
                     s in a teaching posture with figures of devotees worshipping the Buddha
                      with the utmost respect on both sides. </p>
                      <br>
                    <p>
                  <b> Cave IV:</b> Similar to Cave IX, it is a square chaitya with simple and
                   octagonal pillars. Unfortunately, the pillars have been destroyed except for
                    one, giving the idea of the original design. A stupa or a dome-shaped build
                    ing too has been partially destroyed. The decorative elements of the cave 
                    include stepped merlons which can be found in Ajanta Caves also. </p>
                     <br>
                  <p>
                  <b> Cave V:</b> Comparatively a bigger cave, it has immature and unrefined 
                  carvings. The image of the Buddha is seated on a rectangular pedestal in 
                  padmasana with his hands in dhyana mudra. While the shrine door is plain 
                  without any decorations, many figures of Sarasvati Miracle are carved on 
                  the walls.
                </p>
				<br>
                <p>
                   <b> Cave VI:</b> Resembling the characteristics of Ajanta Caves, Cave VI
                    has a porch and a verandah supported by four pillars with a square base.
                     The shrine is carved on a raised platform and is isolated from the back
                      hall. It is protected by two huge dwarapalas. Seated on a lion throne 
                      in a western style, the idol is surrounded by the usual figures of ele
                      phants, vyalas, makaras, etc. Besides these, there are images of male 
                      and female devotees inside the shrine. There are two other subsidiary
                       shrines, each housing a Buddha image. </p>
                       <br>
                     <p>
                     <b> Cave VII:</b> The most developed cave among the three groups, it 
                     has a verandah with four pillars and two pilasters. There are two chapel
                     s on both sides of the verandah; on the left chapel is the panel of Budd
                     hist saktis identified as Tara figures while on the right chapel, the fi
                     gures of Hariti and Pancika are carved. The back wall has windows and a 
                     door leading to another hall. There are several other figures of Ganesha
                     , Nandikesvara and Varaha. The shrine is carved at the centre of the main
                      hall and the doorway is flanked by Tara figures and Naga guardians. On
                       the back wall, two huge sculptures of Avalokitesvara and Manjusri are 
                       carved. </p>
                        <br>
                     <p>
                    <b> Cave VIII:</b> Situated adjacent to Cave VII, it can be accessed thro
                    ugh a staircase on the verandah of Cave VII. It consists of two cells car
                    ved into the left of the hall and three cells carved into the back wall. T
                    wo Buddha figures seated in padmasana position are carved on either side. </p>
                     <br>
                    <p>
                   <b> Caves IX and X:</b> These caves initially had a huge hall with separate
                    compartments and three shrines. However, the entire structure had collapsed. 
                    Presently, there is an unfinished hall which opens to three separate halls a
                    t the back, each leading to a shrine. The main hall is supported by four pill
                    ars while the others are supported by two. There are sculptures of Padmapani
                     in the form of Avalokitesvara, Tara figures, Manjusri etc and many figures 
                     of Buddha. <br>

				<h3>How To Reach Aurangabad Caves  :</h3>  
                  <br>
				<p>
					The Grishneshwar Jyotirlinga decorated with flowers and the holy beads of 
                    Rudraksha.
                    The significance of the temple is that the pilgrims believe that by paying a
                     visit to the Grishneshwar temple, one can reap the benefits of worshiping all
                     the 12 Jyotirlingas. It is also said that the Grishneshwar temple is a classic
                      example of the pre-historic style of architecture and has beautiful carvings.
                     Devotees can see the marriage scene of the Lord and his consort in the temple 
                     murals and carving. The Grishneshwar temple also houses a well that springs holy water. <br>
