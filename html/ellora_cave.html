				<h2>history :</h2>  <br>
				<p>
					Built during 600 to 1000 CE, Ellora Caves lie in the Sahyadri hills in 
                    Aurangabad and is a 2-hour drive from the Ajanta Caves. The Ellora Cav
                    es comprise Hindu, Buddhist and Jain temples and over a 100 caves with
                     only 34 open to the public excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Ch
                     aranandari hills. Ellora Caves served as lodgings to the travelling B
                     uddhist and Jain monks besides being a site for the trade route. Ther
                     e are 17 Hindu caves, 12 Buddhist and five Jain caves with deities, c
                     arvings and even monasteries depicting the mythology of each religion.
                      These caves constructed near each other stand for the harmony and so
                      lidarity among all faiths and beliefs. <br>
                     A part of the Hindu and Buddhist Caves were built during the Rashtrak
                     uta dynasty, and the Jain Caves were built by the Yadav dynasty. It i
                     s not yet established as to which caves were built first - the Hindu 
                     or the Buddhist. Based on the archaeological evidence found at various
                      sites it was deduced that there were essentially three major construc
                      tion periods for the Ellora caves: early Hindu period from 550 to 600
                       CE, Buddhist period from 600 to 730 CE, and the final phase, the Jain
                        and Hindu period lasting from 730 to 950 CE.

				<h3>Ellora Caves Architecture :</h3>   <br>
               <p> Although the deities and idols in the caves have been damaged, the paintings,
                 carvings remain as it is. The inscriptions on the walls of the Ellora Caves
                  date back to the 6th century and a famous one is the Rashtrakuta Dantidurga
                   on the mandapa of Cave 15 inscribed during 753 to 757 AD. Out of all the 
                   excavations done, Cave 16 or Kailasha temple - a monument dedicated to Shi
                   va is the largest single monolithic rock excavated in the world. It was bu
                   ilt during 757-783 AD by Krishna I who was the uncle of Dantidurga.
               </p>  <br>
               <p>
               <b> Hindu Monuments : </b> <br>
                Built during the 6th to 8th century in the Kalachuris period, the Hindu Caves 
                were built in two phases. Caves 14, 15 , 16 were built in the Rashtrakuta per
                iod. The early Hindu caves were dedicated to Shiva with inscriptions depicting
                 the mythology related to other gods as well. A typical attribute of these tem
                 ples was the lingam-yoni placed in the centre of the shrine.
               </p> <br>
               <p>
                 <b> Buddhist Monuments : </b> <br>
                Situated in the south of the precinct, these caves are estimated to have been 
                built during 600 to 730 CE. It was first believed that the Buddhist Caves wer
                e built before the Hindu Caves but this theory was debunked and with enough e
                vidence to substantiate, it was established that the Hindu caves were constru
                cted before the Buddhist came into being. The earliest Buddhist cave to be bu
                ilt was Cave 6, with Cave 11 and 12 being the last. These caves feature monas
                teries, shrines which include bodhisattvas, and carvings of Buddha.
               </p> <br>
               <p>
               <b> Jain Monuments : </b>
                The five caves lying to the north of the Ellora Caves belonging to the Digam
                bara sect were excavated in the 9th to 10th century. Smaller than the Hindu 
                and Buddhist Caves, these have the architectural attributes such as mandapa 
                and a pillared verandah. The Jain temples have the carvings of the yaksa an
                d yaksi, gods and goddesses, and devotees all depicting the Jain mythologica
                l sensibilities of that time.
