				<h2>history :</h2>  <br>
				<p>
					Dilras Banu Begum was a princess belonging to the Persian Safavid
                     Dynasty and was married to Mughal emperor Aurangzeb on 8 May 1637.
                      She went on to become Aurangzeb's chief consort and most beloved 
                      wife as well. She and Aurangzeb had five children - Zeb-un-Nissa,
                       Zinat-un-Nissa, Zubdat-un-Nissa, Muhammad Azam Shah and Sultan 
                       Muhammad Akbar. After the birth of their fifth child, Dilras Banu 
                       Begum contracted a fever which proved to be fatal and she died on 
                       8 October 1657.
				</p> <br>
                <p>
                    Aurangzeb was deeply afflicted due to his beloved wife's death and their 
                    eldest son Azam Shah suffered greatly as well, so much so that he had a 
                    nervous breakdown. In 1660, three years after the death of Dilras Banu 
                    Begum, Aurangzeb commissioned the construction of her final resting place. 
                    Bibi ka Maqbara is said to be built in between 1651 and 1661. According to 
                    the records, the cost of construction of the mausoleum was about seven lakh 
                    rupees. The monument was designed and erected by Ata-Ullah, the architect and
                     Hanspat Rai as the engineer. The marbles used in the construction were brought
                      from the mines in Jaipur. Here, Dilras was buried under the posthumous title of
                       'Rabia-ud-Daurani'.

				<h3>Features of Bibi ka Maqbara :</h3>   <br>
			
				<br>
				<h3>significance of Grishneshwar Temple :</h3>    <br>
                <p>
                   <b> Gardens-</b> Bibi ka Maqbara has four gardens based on Charbagh design like 
                    most of the Mughal gardens. The Maqbara is divided into four equal parts 
                    with the main mausoleum at the centre. Each of the gardens has one building 
                    and they all are equidistant. On the east is the Jamait khana or Aina khana 
                    while on the west is a mosque. On the north side is a Baradari and on the 
                    south is the main entrance which is a huge two-floored building. Throughout 
                    the garden, water courses are laid which are lined with cypress, pine and palm trees. 
                    The gardens are lush green lawns with many seasonal flowers and colourful roses planted 
                    alongside the pathways. At the centre of the pathways leading to four sides are oblong 
                    reservoirs with a total of 61 fountains. The water passes through marble carved sheets 
                    connected to internal wells in the buildings.  Besides this, there are several uniquely 
                    designed cisterns in the garden.  
                </p> <br>
				<p>
                   <b> Main Mausoleum-</b> Designed and erected by Ata-Ullah, the main mausoleum is built on a 
                    raised platform at an elevation of 19 feet and has the Queenâ€™s tomb inside it. On 
                    the top of the huge white dome, there is a brass pot finial and four smaller domes 
                    enclosing the bigger one. The minars are 72 feet high and there is a flight of stairs 
                    which leads you to the top. Inside the main mausoleum, marble jalis cover all the four 
                    sides of the upper floor from where you can spot the tomb of Rabia-ud-Durrani. 
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                   <b> Water Channels-</b> The water required to maintain the huge garden was used from several sources. 
                    It was supplied through underground water channels from Nahar-e-Begumpura, which is in close 
                    proximity to the Maqbara. Within the premises also, there is a separate tank called the Haathi 
                    Hauz. Water was also taken from the famous Nahar-e-Ambari, a water distribution system created 
                    by Malik Amber in 1617. Besides, the garden has many water tanks, cisterns and reservoirs for 
                    supplying water. However, over time the condition of these devices has deteriorated and due 
                    to the shortage of water, the fountains have dried up.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                   <b> Maqbara Complex-</b> Enclosed by high walls, the area of the Maqbara complex is 15000 square feet. 
                    There is a pavilion on each of the four corners of the wall. The cupolas or rounded domes are 
                    octagonal with eight pillars and the cupola roofs are supported on brackets and lintels.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                   <b> Ornamental Elements-</b> Apart from architectural wonders like domes, minarets, gardens and arches, 
                    Bibi ka Maqbara has stunning decorative elements which are distinctive of the Mughal style and 
                    add beauty to the complex. In the making of the Maqbara, stucco painting and stucco plaster were 
                    used instead of rich elements like mosaic, marble screens or peitra dura. The patterns in stucco 
                    paintings are mostly geometric, floral, inscriptional and conventional. In the Maqbara, the main 
                    entrance ceiling has an amazing geometric design. Besides this, relief ornamentation can be seen 
                    in the main mausoleum which has the designs of lotus medallions, rosettes, and mehrab with floral 
                    and leaf patterns. Jali work or Latticework is also heavily used in which immaculate floral, leaf 
                    or geometric designs are cut out in marble screens
                </p>
