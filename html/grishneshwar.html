				<h2>history :</h2>  <br>
				<p>
					The actual date of establishment of the Grishneshwar Temple is unknown
					 but it is believed to be built before the 13th Century. When the Mughal
					  Empire acquired the region that included Velur (now known as Ellora) 
					  where the temple is located, the region witnessed some devastating 
					  Hindu-Muslim conflicts and the temple was destroyed sometime between 
					  the 13th and the 14th Century.Maloji Bhosale, the Grandfather of Chhatrapati 
					  Shivaji Maharaj, as the chief of Verul, played an important role in 
					  rebuilding the temple in the 16th Century. It is said that Maloji Bhosale 
					  found a hidden treasure which he spent in reconstructing the temple and also 
					  built an artificial lake at Shanishingnapur.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Grishneshwar Temple suffered several
					   more attacks by the Mughals even after the 16th Century. It required rebuilding a 
					   few more times during the Mughal-Maratha wars that happened between 1680 and 1707. 
					   In the 18th Century, it was rebuilt for the last time when the Mughal Empire was 
					   defeated by the Marathas. The Queen of Indore, Rani Ahalyabai sponsored the reconstruction 
					   of the temple that can be seen even today.
