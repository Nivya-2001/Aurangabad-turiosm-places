				<p>
					One of the largest irrigation projects in Maharashtra,
                     Jayakwadi Dam is a multipurpose project which aims to
                      irrigate drought-prone Marathwada Region and also to
                       provide water for drinking and industrial usage. Bui
                       lt across Godavari River, its height is approximately
                        41.30 m and length of 9,998 metres with a total stor
                        age capacity 2,909 MCM. Jayakwadi Bird Sanctuary and
                         Dnyaneshwar Dam in the surrounding area make the dam
                          a perfect site to escape the chaos of city life and
                           reminisce the serenity. <br>

                     Dnyaneshwar Udyan is one of the largest gardens in Maharashtra
                      resembling the Brindavan Gardens of Mysore. Close to it is the 
                      bird sanctuary which is the abode of many resident and migratory 
                      birds. For bird lovers and nature buffs, Jayakwadi Dam is surely 
                      heaven.

				<h3>Significance of Jayakwadi Dam :</h3>   <br>
				<p>
                    The initial plan was to build a dam across Godavari River in Beed district
                     near the village of Jaikwadi. However, later it was decided to build the
                      dam 100 km upstream at Paithan. The project, which has a storage capacity
                       of 2909 million cubic metres, was named Jayakwadi after the village and 
                       the proposal was completed by 1964. The foundation was laid by the then 
                       Prime minister of India Lal Bahadur Shastri on 18 October 1965 and was 
                       inaugurated on 24 February 1976 by the then Prime minister Indira Gandhi.
                        The chief engineer of this project was Mr A.A.A. Siddiqui.
                </p>

				<h3>Jayakwadi Bird Sanctuary  :</h3>    <br>
				<p>
					Jayakwadi Bird Sanctuary is spread over an area of 1.25 sq km and houses over
                     200 species of birds which include more than 70 species of migratory birds. 
                     Since the sanctuary is close to Nath Sagar Lake, it provides favourable conditions
                      for aquatic flora and fauna. Notable amongst migratory birds are Cranes, Flamingos,
                       Brahmany Duck, Pochards Teals, Pintails, Wigeon, Shoveller, God Wit, Glossy Ibis, etc.  <br>

                    The aquatic vegetation includes mainly the species of Chara, Spyrogyra, Hydrilla,
                     Potamogeton, Vallisneria etc. An ideal place to escape city life, the sanctuary 
                     attracts bird watchers, nature enthusiasts and photographers in huge numbers every 
                     year.

				<h3>Dnyaneshwar Udyan  :</h3>   <br>
				<p>
					Jnaneshwar Udyan or Dnyaneshwar Udyan is a garden located in the town of Paithan,
                     40 km south of Aurangabad in Maharashtra and is similar to the Brindavan Garden in
                      Mysore. Built in the 1970s by the state government adjacent to Nath Sagar Lake, the
                       garden was named after the saint Jnaneshwar, whose native village was near Paithan
                        and it covers an area of 125 hectares. <br>

                       The highlights of the place include colourful flowerbeds, musical fountains and 
                       vast lawns. In addition to this, it has childrenâ€™s play area, swimming pool, boat
                        rides and a nursey selling spices and saplings. More than a hundred thousand trees 
                        and forty thousand fruit trees add to the beauty of the garden.
