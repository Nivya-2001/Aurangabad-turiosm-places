				<h2>history :</h2>  <br>
				<p>
					The history of Salim Ali Lake dates back to the Mughal era. During the rule
                     of Aurangzeb, the area sprawling from the present day Salim Ali Lake to Beg
                     umpura was nothing but a large marshy tank. Due to excessive dampness, Auran
                     gzeb had a large section of land reclaimed. The portion in front of his pala
                     ce was converted to fields and the reclaimed portion of land made into the Mu
                     ghal Garden, now known as Himayat Bagh. The rest of the land is the lake that 
                     we know today. </p> <br>
                     <p>
                     The site was officially revamped and developed into a public and recreational 
                     place in 2014 and named after Dr Salim Ali, the ‘Birdman of India’ who apart 
                     from being a legendary ornithologist contributed tonnes for the Indian ecology
                      and made people aware of what bird-watching is. It is because of him that bird 
                      watching today is one of the most sought after hobbies. He contributed a lot 
                      towards wildlife conservation and performed extensive bird surveys.
