				<h2>history :</h2>  <br>
				<p>
					Ajanta caves are essentially Buddhist monasteries of the bygone era. It is a place where 
                    Buddhist monks lived, studied and prayed. The Ajanta caves were first found by a few 
                    British soldiers in the 19th century when they were out hunting and one of them happened 
                    to lay his eyes on a cave covered with bushes, leaves and stones. The soldiers made their 
                    way into the cave and found many caves with such history in them. They informed the Government 
                    and ever since Ajanta caves are being excavated and studied to this day. It was declared a World 
                    Heritage Site in 1983. The caves have been built in two phases: Satvahana followed by Vakataka 
                    period named so after the ruling dynasty. The first phase lasted from 100B CE to 100 CE, when 
                    the sanctuaries were built in the canyons of the Waghora river and called Chaitya-griha. 
                    Caves 9, 10, 12, 15A are from this period. During the second phase, around 20 cave temples 
                    were built which resemble modern day monasteries with a sanctum in the rear end of the cave.

				<h3>Architecture of Ajanta caves  :</h3>   <br>
				<p>
                    The walls and ceilings of the famous Ajanta caves are chiselled, carved and 
                    painted with the life and teachings of Lord Buddha. There is a total of 30 
                    caves that bring to your notice the talent of the people and their dedicati
                    on to preserving the past in the form of a never fading art. The Ajanta cav
                    es consist of caves dedicated to both Hinayana and Mahayana sect. The Ajant
                    a caves consist of 24 Buddhist Viharas and 5 Hindu temples. Cave 1, 2, 4, 1
                    6, 17 are considered the most beautiful and the famous statue of the reclin
                    ing Buddha is located in cave 26. The Viharas (hall of the prayer of the mo
                    nks) are of different sizes that consist of a pillared verandah in front, f
                    rom which doors and windows lead into the main hall. The side walls of the 
                    hall have doors for the monks to enter their cells. In the center of the ma
                    in wall is a door that leads us to a room with a huge rock cut sculpture of
                     Lord Buddha. The paintings on the walls of the Ajanta caves mainly adopt t
                     he theme of Jataka tales, the stories with morals that we read as kids. Ev
                     ery single painting has a story attached to it and the paints used are both
                      rare and made from very expensive and imported materials. The artists and
                       craftsmen of those times did not leave any detail to imagination making 
                       them all look very life like.

				<h3>Best Time To Visit Ajanta Caves :</h3>    <br>
				<p>
					The months of June to March are considered good time to visit the Ajanta caves.
                     While the winter season (November to February) is the best time to visit the 
                     caves, the monsoon season (from June to September) is also a good time as the
                      temperature cools down due to rains. Avoid the summers (April to June) as the
                       temperature touches 40 degrees frequently and it could be too hot to explore
                        the caves.

				<h3>How To Reach Ajanta Caves :</h3>   <br>
				<p>
					Ajanta Caves is situated around 113 km north of Aurangabad and 50 kms from Jalgaon.
                     The nearest airport is in Jalgaon (50 km) and is linked to Mumbai and Ahmedabad. 
                     The best-connected airport is in Aurangabad (100 km) and is linked to Delhi, Udaipur
                     , Jaipur and Mumbai.
                     The best way to reach the caves from the airport is in a private car or taxi. It 
                     would take around 2 and half hours by car and around 3 hours by bus to reach the 
                     Ajanta Caves from Aurangabad. However, if you want to use public transport, you 
                     can commute using local buses.
                     The bus to Ajanta Caves can be taken from the Aurangabad Central Bus Station located
                      on Aurangabad Road. This bus ride will be roughly 3 hours long, so be prepared and 
                      pack some snacks as well. The bus will drop you at Ajanta Caves Road Entrance where
                       some shops and restaurants are present for tourists. From there, you can take another
                        bus to the entrance of the main caves which would hardly take 10 minutes. Beware that
                         these are local buses and can be slightly rough for a lot of tourists.
                      Aurangabad is directly linked to Mumbai and Pune by the Tapovan Express and Devgiri Express.
                       Ajanta is also well-connected by road to Mumbai, Pune and other cities of Maharashtra.
