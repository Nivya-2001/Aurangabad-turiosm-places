				<h2>history :</h2>  <br>
				<p>
					The town of Daulatabad was once known as 'Devgiri' meaning the 'the hill
                     of gods'. The entire township was developed by the King of Yadava dynas
                     ty, Raja Bhillamraj Yadav in 1187. The fort is considered among the bes
                     t-preserved forts in the country which has survived several years witho
                     ut any alteration. The prosperous kingdom of Yadava dynasty was taken 
                     over by the Tughlaq dynasty of Delhi under the leadership of Mohammad B
                     in Tughlaq who captured the town of Devgiri along with the two forts. </p> <br>
                     <p>
                     At the beginning of 1327, when the city of Devgiri was taken over by the
                      Tughlaq dynasty, the name of the place was forcefully changed from Devg
                      iri to Daulatabad. In 1328, Daulatabad was completely taken over by the
                       Sultanate of Delhi and was established as a capital of Tughlaq dynasty
                        for the coming two years. The huge population was moved to Daulatabad
                         in order to set up the rule of Tughlaq dynasty in the city. The city
                          was abandoned by the Delhi rulers due to the lack of water supply 
                          in the area. Within the span of two years, the capital of the Tughl
                          aq dynasty was soon shifted back to Delhi leaving Daulatabad in an 
                          abandoned state.

				<h3>Architecture of Daulatabad Fort :</h3>   <br>
			<p>
                The strategic and powerful construction of the Daulatabad Fort makes
                 it amongst the most well-preserved forts in the country. It is loca
                 ted on the top of a conical hill and the lower part is surrounded by
                  the moat which was filled with crocodiles to protect the entry of en
                  emies. The whole fort is protected by several bastions. During the pe
                  riod of Tughlaq dynasty, it was further strengthened by the various c
                  anons and the strong wall of 5 km was built to protect the mighty edi
                  fice. There are several mazes and puzzles built at the entrance of th
                  e grand fort as a strategic measure to prevent the entry of unknowns. 
                  A 30 metre Chand Minar was also built inside the fort during the rule
                   of Tughlaq dynasty.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                The construction of the Devgiri Fort was peculiar in its own right, and
                 it was meant to be such so that any enemy marching towards it is thrown
                  off track. The fort had a single doorway which served as both the entr
                  ance and the exit. This was done so that any enemy troops who try to pe
                  netrate through the fort looking for an exit get trapped in the premises
                  . In the olden days, intoxicated elephants were used to break open the g
                  ates of the forts. To avoid such a situation, the Daulatabad Fort has a s
                  pecial provision of spikes on the gates which gave an instant death to the
                   giant beast.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                Dauatabad had no parallel gates which were meant to confuse the enemy and the
                 flag mast of the fort was situated on the left-hand side. When the enemy tri
                 ed to attack the same, they turned left, but the exit gates were on the righ
                 t, which further trapped them in the labyrinth of the fort. Serpentine arrang
                 ements of entryways, false doorways, peculiarly curved walls and many such r
                 uses were used in the wall to confuse the enemy and eventually condemn them t
                 o defeat. Even the smooth and curved shape of the hill was used to protect the
                  Daulatabad Fort against mountain lizard climbers, who would miserably fail if
                   they tried to climb up the mountain.
            </p>

				<h3>Trekking to the Top of Daulatabad Fort :</h3>    <br>
				<p>
					One of the most challenging parts of a visit to the Daulatabad Fort is 
                    reaching the top of this mighty edifice, which can only be accessed on 
                    foot. You will have to walk up 750 stairs which can take anywhere betwe
                    en 1-3 hours depending on your speed. The difficulty level is easy to m
                    edium and there are a few dark areas along the way for which you need t
                    o carry a torch. You will get to experience the peculiarities of Daulat
                    abad Fort as well, such as the fact that no two entrances are in front 
                    of each other, which are quite interesting to note and observe as you g
                    o. All the effort and time is made worth by the view from the summit, wh
                    ich is a fascinating testimony of the architectural brilliance of the med
                    ieval times.
