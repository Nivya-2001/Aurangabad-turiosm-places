				<h2>history :</h2>  <br>
				<p>
					About 37 kilometres away from the city of Aurangabad in Maharashtra,
                     Mhaismal is a beautiful, unexplored hill station tucked amidst the
                      Sahyadri Ranges at an altitude of over 106 metres above the sea level.
                       Also titled as the 'Mahabaleshwar of Marathwada', Mhaismal is a perfe
                       ct blend of the undefiled nature and the breathtaking terrains. It s 
                       famous for its temples, gardens, valleys, caves and forts all adding
                        to its inherent natural charm. The pristine ambience of the place is a
                         treat for the tired urban eyes looking for a quiet weekend getaway from
                          Mumbai, Aurangabad or Pune. </p> <br> 
                      <p>
                  The hill station has a plateau with lush greenery, hills and forest cover 
                  which is a natural paradise that photographers and nature lovers seek. It
                   is also famous as a Botanical Workshop for the wide variety of flora and
                    fauna it has in store. Mhaismal, although offbeat, is slowly getting po
                    pularity because of the greenery that is it adorned with during the mon
                    soons, the wide range of flora it has in store, the bamboo brown forests
                     and the queer village.
